- Implemented non-parallel Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm: [An Efficient Parallel Biconnectivity Algorithm]{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220617428_An_Efficient_Parallel_Biconnectivity_Algorithm}.
- incorporated DSUs when adding edges to Gâ€™.
- Implemented [Tarjan's Algorithm]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_algorithm}.
- Compared performance of both on various types of graphs of various sizes.
- Result: Tarjan-Vishkin with DSUs performances better than Tarjan's on Large Graphs.

## Execution

- for each code, run the command `g++ -std=c++17 -Ofast filename.cpp -o filename`.
- and then run `./filename < input_file > output_file`.
- to generate random graphs use `randomgraph.cpp` and run `./randomgraph > input_file`.
- number of vertices and edges can be changed in the code.

## Assumptions

- The graph need not be connected.
- graph need not be simple.
- graph doesn't have self-loops.
